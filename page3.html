        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Its wonderful how delicious those fruits of delight can be. Nonetheless it is unequivocally perillous world we live in. Sun goes right and wrong, up and down, shine and round. Ample be apples of gorgeous ruler to condemn some weary orders and stomp. One devours another one, here comes divine dichotomy and blossom cherry trees.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Wine and rum are hailing in the wineglasses and ponds. World turns, time goes, they get on, get by, get to and got them. Pearls are golden, but not all the gold is worth. Scarce life in the face of void, dark strange flowers of stones in a trip to what is seen are somewhat trechurous. Steps are heavy and piercing. Dooms are justice and terror. Evil is acceptable and risky. Nor land is promised by anyone whos above the living creatures. Wealth goes by and humanity goes its way. Money sacrificed the walls to beings that was at home at last. It might be unknown there these beings will head to since now. Greatly preserved are pristine ones and those who wasn't exposed to same happenings are different ones. You can say they are not the same. You can say they are. You can say they are of less worth. Will it be erroueous announcement? Will it be true and pure? Will it be worth of living? Or is this a pathetic one? Brightly shine the sun and fires the pitiful ones, they having its food and its warmth but forgetting to exist in the one place they are thinking. Was it worth to have this conversations about lies and deceit whule talking you was the greatest ever existed? Declare the peace and burn it, destroy your trust at cliffs and bury, denounce your creator and make a laugh  at him if you ever thought it was a good idea and never thought it wasn't. You can check the reality itself but then understand it aswell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Life can be accurate and it can be chaos altogether. Life is something and chaos is something. You can give a name to life and name to chaos and it won't be mistake. But if your assumptions are correlating with the world you thought and at one moment the same world isn't there -- you speaking through the words and swimming in the swamp. Words are greedy and helpful, life is dirty and grumpy, to scurry away is to defeat when the present is last. Help yourself with whatever you want. Take the road whatever it be. Spell to your friends whatever we need and then understand how lost you are in the escaping of bad news, good news, old friends, good blues, bad blues, bad moods, steel swords, straight rules, good charms, real truths, slayed harms big tooth's.</p>
